# M1IoT-interruptlab
Intrrupt Lab for M1 IoT and Cyber security

## Before interruption
Check and test arduino sketch in arduino IDE that toggle a leb when pusshing a button 
[see the code](mbeggas/M1IoT-interruptlab/arduino_code/led-button.ino)

Now we will add a delay to above code and adding other work to the microcontroller in the main loop, saying serial sending and delay. Now see what happen when pushing the button
[see the code](arduino_code/leb-buitton√®withdelay.ino)

The microcontroller not responding to the pushbutton signal when it is occupied bu the other work

## What is interruption
